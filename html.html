     <p>Html and Other stuff</p>
    
      <p>Html is a program that someone writes code in. Html stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. Html was created in 1991 by Tim Berners-Lee. He is also the invertor and founder on the World Wibe Web. Its written by using various "tags". These tags make the program do different things. For example the <p> tag starts a paragraph. Tags work by adding different signs to the start and end of the commands.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</p>
  <p>CSS is basically used to change the colors or background of your Htlm. I would like to say its the beautification of the Html.</p>

<p>Its very simple to use. For example when want to change the font family in css you make a new file named "stylesheet.css" Then you write "p{ then press enter a couple of times then }. You can change things in css that make it easier to make your website look better. </p>
 
  <p>A tag is something that you use to start a specific part in html or css. Like for this paragraph im writing I am using the"
    p" tag. An atribute is used to select elements with a specific atribute such as the background color</p>
