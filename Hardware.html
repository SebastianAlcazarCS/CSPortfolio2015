<p>The Mother Board: The mother board contains all of the electronics to make the computer work. A printed circut that contains the key components for the device.</p>

<p>CPU: Central Processing Unit. Its the brain of the computer where most of the calculations are doen. </p>

<p>These three things are what we type and are able to see what we are doing a lot easier. They work together because the mouse moves on the monitor to see on the screen, the keyboard types stuff in, and the monitor is how you see everything. </p>
<p>Different components communicate with eachother by electrical currents. Without every thing in the computer it wont work and it'll screw up. Just like in Html is one thing is wrong, everything is wrong and doesn't work.</p>
