<p>Intro to computer science is in room 14. Summit is in Redwood City,California and is an independant school. Summits goal is that ALL students go to college. My name is Sebastian Alcazar and Im a student in the class.</p>

<p>The main purpose of this class in my opinion is to have an understading of coding so we know how to. We are over all learning how to code in a program called Caret. We are making THIS website so that you can read it and understand what we are doing. By the end of this class we are going to have a website done and have learned how to code.</p>

<p>There are many things to see on my webpage. Such as my About You, Welcome,Html, and hardware. </p>
